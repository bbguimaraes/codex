\subsection{Utilities}

Throughout this chapter, a number of utility functions will be used in the
implementation of algorithms.  Some will be described as part of each section,
but a few basic ones are presented here.

\subsubsection{\texttt{is\_sorted}}

A C version of the same function in the C++ standard library.

\lstinputlisting
    [style=c,firstline=3,lastline=10]
    {algo/fundamentals/utils.h}

\subsubsection{\texttt{lsearch}}

Used in contrast to \texttt{bsearch} in examples in C.
